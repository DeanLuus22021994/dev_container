| P0 | Critical - Blocking further development or causing production issues |
| P1 | High - Should be addressed in current sprint |
| P2 | Medium - Should be addressed in near future |
| P3 | Low - Nice to have improvements |

| Effort | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| E1 | Small - Less than 1 day |
| E2 | Medium - 1-3 days |
| E3 | Large - 3-5 days |
| E4 | Extra Large - 5+ days |

## How to Use This Document

This document is intended to be used with the VSCode agent for tracking and addressing technical debt:

1. **Issue Creation**: Create GitHub issues for action items as they are prioritized.
2. **Progress Tracking**: Update the checkboxes as items are completed.
3. **Regular Review**: Review this document in sprint planning to select items for upcoming work.
4. **Continuous Updates**: Add new items as technical debt is identified during development.

## Automation and Integration

- This document integrates with VSCode agent for automated tracking.
- Items can be converted to GitHub issues using the debt-to-issue automation.
- Progress is automatically tracked and reported in development metrics.

## Reporting Issues

When adding new technical debt items:

1. Follow the priority/effort format.
2. Include specific file paths or components affected.
3. Link to relevant issues or discussions.
4. Add justification for priority assessment.
